# Isepapp
Web Technologies Project ISEP - 2015 ([@ISEP](http://www.isep.fr))

### Context:
Since the first semester of [@ISEP](https://twitter.com/Isep) engineering school is "project driven", we need a less traditional way to evaluate students. Here is why the "product owner" is asking for a software answering to those requirements.
The system must allow us to:

1. Set-up list of skills & edit it through multiple semester
2. Specify the level of each student for those skills
3. Convert the levels into Mark and compute an average
4. Get deliveries (pdf format) and count missing
