Web Technologies Project ISEP - 2015 ([@ISEP](http://www.isep.fr))

### Context:
Since the first semester of [@ISEP](https://twitter.com/Isep) engineering school is "project driven", we need a less traditional way to evaluate students. Here is why the "product owner" is asking for a software answering to those requirements.
The system must allow us to:

- [x] Set-up list of skills & edit it through multiple semester
- [x] Specify the level of each student for those skills
- [x] Convert the levels into Mark and compute an average
- [ ] Get deliveries (pdf format) and count missing
- [ ] Rise a warrning for an under threshold average
